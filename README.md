Each player's physical attributes and performance metrics are recorded, providing insights into their potential impact on the court. By analyzing these variables, one can assess correlations between physical measurements and draft picks, identify standout performers, and make predictions about future success. Visualizations such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plot ,and reggression plots help to reveal trends and patterns within the data, supporting data-driven decisions in player selection and team composition.
